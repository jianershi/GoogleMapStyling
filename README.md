#Google Map Design

This is the map I used in [IP Lookup](https://github.com/paulshi/iplookup) project. I really like it and I think it makes sense to make a separate project so the template can be reused easily.

##Main File
```googlemapStyle.js``` defines the style of the google map

```noun_project_16939.svg``` is the marker styling


##Credit
[Map marker](http://thenounproject.com/noun/map-marker/#icon-No16939) was designed by [Kelly Walker](http://thenounproject.com/kellylesliewalker/) from The Noun Project
